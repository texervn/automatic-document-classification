Apple and other American technology companies have faced calls from President Trump to boost employment in their home country.Most recently, the president threatened to add tariffs to iPhones and other Apple products manufactured in China if trade negotiations with Beijing did not go the way he wanted.Last month, Amazon announced plans to build new campuses in New York and near Washington DC as part of its own job-creation plans.
