PewDiePie, also known as Felix Kjellberg, joined the chorus of criticism in a video saying Rewind featured too much of the Fortnite game and too few YouTubers.Prominent YouTuber Marques Brownlee said Rewind had been a "big celebration" of YouTubers and the biggest events that had happened on the site in a particular year."It became an honour to be included in Rewind," said Mr Brownlee.But now, he said, YouTube saw Rewind as a way to "showcase all the best stuff that happens on YouTube for advertisers".Instead of honouring creators, said Mr Brownlee, it was now a list of "advertiser-friendly" content. "Rewind has turned into a giant ad for YouTube," he said.
