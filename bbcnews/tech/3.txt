These could have had ties to "state-sponsored actors", Twitter said.Stressing that they could not confirm "intent or attribution for certain", Twitter's statement said they had informed the authorities about their discovery in the interest of "full transparency". Those directly affected have been informed, Twitter said. No full phone numbers were revealed, nor any other personal data. The company's stock price dropped nearly 7% on Monday.News of the bug comes on the same day the US Senate released a report revealing how Russia used every social media platform to influence the 2016 election.
